Faraday's Law - Implementation Notes
====================

The user drags the MagnetNodeWithField through the CoilNode(s), which drives the Voltmeter.signalProperty and
Voltmeter.needleAngleProperty, depicted in the VoltmeterGauge by the needle deflection and by the BulbNode brightness.
This simulation is instrumented for PhET-iO and accessibility, and is involved in experimental sonification work (in a
branch).
